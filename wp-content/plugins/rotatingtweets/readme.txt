Twitter widget and shortcode to show your latest tweets one at a time an animated rotation

== Description ==
* **Replaces a [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) such as `[rotatingtweets screen_name='your_twitter']`, or a [widget](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets), with a rotating display of your most recent tweets**
* **Supports v 1.1 of the Twitter API** ([i.e. it still works](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/api-v1-is-retired))
* **Space efficient** - instead of showing all your tweets at once, shows one at a time and then smoothly replaces it with the next one. After showing all your tweets, loops back to the beginning again.
* **Reliable** - keeps showing your latest Tweets even if the Twitter website is down.
* **Customisable** - you decide whose tweets to show, how many to show, whether to include retweets and replies, and whether to show a follow button. You can also decide how quickly the tweets rotate and what type of animation to use.
* **Responsive** - resizes as your page resizes
* Gives you the option to show a fully customisable Twitter 'follow' button
* Replaces [t.co](http://t.co) links with the original link
* Caches the most recent data from Twitter to avoid problems with rate limiting
* Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [jQuery.Cycle](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/) and [jQuery.Cycle2](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/) to produce a nice smooth result.
* **Multi-lingual** - now set up to be multi-lingual. The Twitter 'follow' button is automatically translated to match your site's language setting [if Twitter has made the appropriate language available](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/help/languages). Also uses [Wordpress's multi-lingual capability](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) to enable translation of all the other text used by the plug-in via language packs.

Currently the following languages are available:

* US English *(complete)*
* British English *(complete - mainly changing 'favorite' to 'favourite'!)*
* Brazilian Portuguese *(complete - many thanks to Wilmerson Felipe for his help on this)*
* German *(almost complete - many thanks to Nils Kroneberg for his help on this)*
* Spanish *(basic tweet display only)*
* Italian *(basic tweet display only)*
* Dutch *(public facing translation complete - many thanks to Natasja Weijer for her help on this)*
* French *(almost complete - many thanks to [Alexandre Trudel](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/alexandretrudel) for his help on this)*
* Serbian *(complete - many thanks to Borisa Djuraskovic at [Web Hosting Hub](http://www.webhostinghub.com/) for his help on this)*

If you have made the plug-in work in your language, please send the translations you'd like to see or, even better, the relevant [gettext PO and MO files](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) to [me](http://www.martintod.org.uk/contact-martin/) and I will then share them with everyone else. You can download [the latest POT file](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/rotatingtweets/trunk/languages/rotatingtweets.pot), and [PO files in each language](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/rotatingtweets/trunk/languages/) from this site. You may find [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) rather useful for translation and creation of PO and MO files - although the PO files themselves are quite simple text files and can be edited in Notepad or [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

If you'd like to see what the plug-in looks like in action, you can [see the plug-in working here](http://www.martintod.org.uk/2012/05/29/new-twitter-plugin-to-show-tweets-in-rotation/).

== Installation ==
= Installation =
1. Upload the contents of `rotatingtweets.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the Wordpress installer
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the [My applications page](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) on the Twitter website to set up your website as a new Twitter 'application'. You may need to log-in using your Twitter user name and password.
1. If you don't already have a suitable 'application' to use for your website, set one up on the [Create an Application page](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new). It's normally best to use the name, description and website URL of the website where you plan to use Rotating Tweets. You don't need a Callback URL.
1. After clicking **Create your Twitter application**, on the following page, click on **Create my access token**.
1. Copy the **Consumer key**, **Consumer secret**, **Access token** and **Access token secret** from your Twitter application page into the Rotating Tweets settings page. Hit save. If there is a problem, you will see an error message.
1. Place a shortcode such `[rotatingtweets screen_name='mpntod']` in your post or page, or use a widget

= Set-up =
Options include:

1. Going to the Widgets menu on the admin page and adding the Rotating Tweets widget. Options include the name of the Twitter account to show, whether to show retweets and the speed of rotation.
1. Using the basic Rotating Tweets shortcode, for example `[rotatingtweets screen_name='mpntod']`
1. Using a more complicated Rotating Tweets shortcode, for example `[rotatingtweets screen_name='mpntod' include_rts='1' tweet_count='7' timeout='3000']`

= Shortcode variables =
Possible variables for the shortcode include:

* **Required settings** - at least one of the following three settings is required for the short-code to function:
	* `screen_name` = Twitter user name
	* `url` = Twitter user URL. If `screen_name` is empty and this link is valid, `screen_name` will be set to the user name included in `url`
	* `search` = a term to search for. There's a useful guide to using Twitter's search function at https://support.twitter.com/articles/71577-using-advanced-search

	* `links_in_new_window` = `'0'` or `'1'` - show links in a new tab or window - default is `'0'`
	* `rotation_type` = If you are using version 1 of the JavaScript, you can use any of the options listed on the [jQuery.cycle website](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/browser.html) - default is `'scrollUp'.`  If you are using version 2 of the JavaScript, then the options are `'scrollUp'`,`'scrollDown'`,`'scrollHorz'`,`'scrollLeft'`,`'scrollRight'`,`'toss'`,`'scrollVert'`,`'fade'` and `'carousel'`
		*	`carousel_horizontal` = `0` or `1` - if you've chosen 'carousel' as a rotation type, allow horizontal scrolling - default is `0`
		*	`carousel_count` = ''number'' - if you've chosen 'carousel' as a rotation type, set the number of slides to appear in the carousel - default is 3 for vertical carousel and enough to fill the width of the page for horizontal carousel

	* `show_media` = `'0'` or `'1'` - experimental option that shows images with the tweet - default is `'0'`

* All the people who have given advice and suggested improvements

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What options can I use for the shortcode? =
All the options are listed on the [Rotating Tweets installation page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rotatingtweets/installation/).

= How can I include Rotating Tweets in my template? =
Try something like:
`<?php echo do_shortcode( "[rotatingtweets screen_name='your_twitter']" ) ?>`

= How can I pull information from two accounts into one widget =
The easiest way is to list more than one account in the 'Twitter name' box in the widget or use something like `screen_name = 'account1 account2'` in the shortcode.

= How often does the plug-in call Twitter =
In most cases, each use (or "instance") of this plug-in gets data from Twitter every 2 minutes. The exception is when two or more instances share the same settings (screen name etc.), in which case they share the same data rather than each calling it separately.

= My Rotating Tweets are not updating. What can I do? =
This normally happens if there is an SSL problem. Try going to the settings page and switching off SSL validation.

If this doesn't solve the problem, check your Twitter API key settings.

If neither of these approaches work, Rotating Tweets will normally be reporting the error as a comment in the HTML of your page. This should give you an idea of how to solve the problem.

= The Rotating Tweets are not rotating. What can I do? =
This normally happens if there is more than one copy of `jQuery` installed on a page - or more than one copy of `jQuery.cycle`.

To see if this is the case, search the HTML on your website to see if either script is called more than once.  To do this:

1. Open the page.
1. Right click and select 'View Page Source' or 'View Source'
1. Hit `[CTRL]+F` and search for `jquery`
1. Look out for lines that contain `jquery.min.js` or `jquery.cycle.all.min.js`.  Neither script should appear more than once.

The problem is that the second (or third) copy of the script overwrites all previous versions and the scripts that go with them.  This is particularly likely to happen with old templates or plug-ins.

If this is the case:

1. Check is that you have upgraded your template or your plug-in to the latest version.
1. If this still doesn't work, please let me know which plug-in or template is causing the problem and I'll see if I can build a fix into the next version of Rotating Tweets.

If there is only one copy of `jquery` and of `jquery.cycle` on your page, the best way to look for the problem is to open the 'console'. To do this:

1. Press `[F12]` (in Chrome or IE) or `[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+K` (in Firefox)
1. Load the page where you have a problem
1. In Chrome or IE, select the tab marked 'console'.
1. Read the diagnostics and look for any problems that relate to JavaScript. This will normally tell you which JavaScript (if any) is having problems.

= What can I do if I get the WordPress error code: `http_request_failed - name lookup timed out`? =
Try installing the [Core Control plug-in](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/core-control/) and disabling cURL. You can read more about the problem via [this support page](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-351-wordpress-error-code-http_request_failed-name-lookup-timed-out).

Thank you to [darkiko](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/darkiko) for sharing their solution to this problem.

= My widget is too wide! =
Try putting:
`
div.widget_rotatingtweets_widget, div.rotatingtweet, div.widget_rotatingtweets_widget div.widget-title {
	max-width: 123px;
}
`
into your CSS - changing `123px;` to the width you're aiming at - either via putting `rotatingtweets.css` into `wp-content/uploads` or by editing your own template files.

= How can I add a Twitter bird to the left of my tweets? =
You can do this by going to the `rotatingtweets/css` directory and renaming `rotatingtweets-sample.css` to `rotatingtweets.css` and putting it in the `wp-content/uploads/` directory.  This displays a Twitter bird to the left of your tweets.  Any CSS you put into `rotatingtweets.css` won't be overwritten when the plug-in is upgraded to the latest version.
