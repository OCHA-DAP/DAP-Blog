HDX Blog 
===============================

The blog is based on WordPress (http://wordpress.org/). It was developed on top of the `Acute` theme by ThemeBeans (http://themebeans.com/).

C3 (D3.js) Plots
----------------

Authors can now publish [C3.js](http://www.c3js.org) plots on their posts or other pages of the blog. In order to work, the authors have to add the JavaScript code within `<script>` tags and carefuly format them to avoid WordPress' auto-formatter to get in the way of making the charts work.
